Keys:

- R: refactoring / reorganization
- F: features
- L: language features
- B: bugs
- T: testing


Meat
----

- finish the "canonical form"

- intervals - what happens 

- the meat! make sure we close all the loops at the same time.

Incoming
---------
 

- R: Replace conf_tools completely. 
- L: Add something like:

  my_npd.mcdp
  from-code('module.function', {param1=..., param2=...})


- B: the @comptests inside example_battery are not used now. Use make w/ comptest command?
 


Misc
-----

- R: add license information



- T: mcdplib: create stand-alone ``mcdp-test`` for each ``.mcdplib``

- B: automatically load CSS from that file.
 

MCDP-web
----------


- F: rename model

- F: delete model

 
  
- F: better initial list for each library

- B: when drawing images, use a unicode font

- F: send to non-fancy for internet explorer

- F: mcdp-web: nice CSS all around

- T: mcdp-web: Testing of at least all links.

- F: mcdp-web: let images be zoomable

- B: fancy_editor: the syntax highlighting skips the whitespace at the end of the model

- R: mcdp-web: reorganize by folder

- B: mcdp-web: make sure that everything works when packaged

- F: automatically parse and execute the snippets in the Markdown documents

- F: create static versions of documents

- B: we need to escape # in interactive. Maybe hexify?
http://127.0.0.1:8080/interactive/mcdp_value/#finite_poset { %0A    a <= b <= c  %0A    x <= c <= d # test%0A    e <= a1 # test%0A}

MCDP-web / QR
-------------

- put the "new model" link everywhere (list of models, /index)
- put the navigation bar everywhere


- B: unicode characters such as âŸ¨ give server-side error

Bugs
----

- B: FinitePoset does not have Join, Meet

- B: Sometimes Pint does not simplify the units. For example,
      J * kg / Wh has the same dimensionality of kg

- B: compact() is bugged - it has to do with splits. Try compact DroneComplete.

- B: "(provided lift)^2" does not parse
- B: "nat:2 / 1 []"

There is already a connection to function 'r1' of '_res_r1'.


 line  4 >  requires r2 [R]
 line  5 >
 line  6 >  f1  <= 1 [] + (r1 * (r2 + r1)  )
            ^
            |
            here or nearby
``` 

- F: nice icon for  operations: take
- F: nice icon for  operations: meet, Join


- B: there is now an ugly hack (Catch exception ) when plotting in gg_*

Language additions
------------------

- L: New language feature: templates

- L: types: Sets without the order. For example, given V, use set(V).
- L: values: Indexing. For example:

	```
	mcdp {
	   provides f [X x USD]
	   requires cost [USD]

	   cost >= f[1]
	}
	```

- L: Syntax for empty sets. ``{} g`` or  ``empty g`` 


- L: Implement Python-style comments for more literate programming.

```
mcdp {
   """ this is the comment """

  provides x [J] "This is a comment for the description"
}
```

- L: named tuples

  T = namedtuple(T: Type, U: Type)



- Bug in the dot drawing for this one:

choose(
        NiMH: mcdp { a = instance mcdp {
provides f1 <= 10g
requires r1 >= f1
}
}
)

- F: "choose()" without labels
   (get rid of ^?)


- F: better catalouge syntax - implicit point


  Putin = catalogue {
     provides plutonium [g]
     requires science [`scientific_objectives]
     100g | `scientific_objectives : find_current_life
     implicit : 100g | `scientific_objectives : find_current_life
  }

  catalouge { 
     provides resolution [pixels]
     requires latency [s]


     500 pixels => 10
  }



- g: visualize PlusNat as "+ x"
