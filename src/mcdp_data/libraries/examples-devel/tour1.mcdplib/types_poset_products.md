### Products

Use the Unicode symbol "``×``" (or even the simple letter ``x``) to create poset products.

For example:

<pre class='mcdp_poset'>
J × A
</pre>

This represents a product of Joules and Amperes.

### Named products (in development)

<pre class='mcdp_poset'>
product(energy:J, current:A)
</pre>
