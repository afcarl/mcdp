Step 1 - autonomy functionality 

    obstacle_avoidance(pfailure, environment)

    object_detection(p_success, classes) 

    environment 


Step 2 - process flows

    [sensor1(sampling)] -> [algorithm1(resolution)] -> [algorithm2]

    [sensor2(sampling)] -> [algorithm1(resolution)] -> [algorithm2]


Step 3 - implementation

    [x86_ops, arm_ops, cuda_ops]

Step 4 - power, cost

    power, cost



[camera(120Hz, 200 px)] -> process

    Each edge
