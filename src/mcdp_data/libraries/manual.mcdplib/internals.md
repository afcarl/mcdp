# Behind the scenes

This chapter provides a description of the computation that is happening behind
the scenes, including the intermediate representation formats.

Before looking at this, you should read some of the papers; see \ref{papers}.


## Overview of processing flow

This is a summary of the processing steps:

    MCDPL string
    |
    Syntax Tree
    |
    Syntax tree with semantic annotations  -->  pretty-printed strings
    |
    Graphical representation
    |
    Algebraic tree representation


### MCDPL strings


### Syntax Trees


### Annotated syntax trees

#### Resolution of names

### Graphical representation

### Algebraic representation


## Posets and antichains representation

Use discrete antichain...

This is quite ingrained everywhere... one could use e.g. "convex representation"
but this is good for generality.


## Details of the algorithms


Where is the bottleneck?...
