## Relation to other languages

Modeling languages for optimization have a long history~\cite{kallrath12}.

[Prolog][prolog] can also be considered as a modeling language to describe
logical relations (though note that the Prolog specification describes
also how inference works in that context).

#### Fortress

Some aspects of MCDPL were inspired by a language called [Fortress][fortress]\cite{fortress} that was developed by Guy Steele and team at Sun during the period 2005--2012.<footnote>It was funded by the DARPA
[High Productivity Computing Systems (HPCS)][HPCS], but it didn't make the latter phase  of the program, so it was eventually abandoned.</footnote>.

MCDPL uses these ideas from Fortress:

* the liberal use of *Unicode characters*, that make the models similar to the
  mathematical expressions. This is used both for operators
  as well as identifiers (e.g. ``ρ_1`` is a synonim of ``rho₂``).
   See <a href="#sub:unicode"/> for details.
* the use of *units* in the basic type system.
