\caption{\label{fig:intro}A \emph{design problem }is a relation that relates
the implementations available to the \F{functionality provided}
 and the \R{resources required}, both represented as partially ordered
sets. A\emph{ co-design problem }is the interconnection of two or
more design problems. An edge in a co-design diagram like in the figure
represent a \emph{co-design constraint}: the resources required by
the first design problem are a lower bound for the functionality to
be provided by the second. The optimization problem to be solved is:
find the solutions that are minimal in resources usage, given a lower
bound on the functionality to be provided. }
