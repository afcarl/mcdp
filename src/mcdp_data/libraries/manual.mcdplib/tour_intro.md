## The minimal MCDP

The minimal MCDP can be defined as in [](#code:empty).

<col2>
    <pre class='mcdp' id='empty' figure-id='code:empty' label='empty.mcdp'
    style='min-width: 8em'>
    mcdp {

    }
    </pre>
    <render class='fancy_editor' figure-id="fig:empty">`empty</render>
</col2>

The code describes an MCDP with zero functionality or resources.
The functionality and resources spaces are $\funsp=\One$, $\ressp=\One$.
The space $\One = \{ \langle\rangle \}$ is the empty product, which contains only one element, the empty tuple $\langle\rangle$.
You might think about $\One$ as providing one bit of information:
whether something is feasible or not.

The model above can already be queried using the program <program>mcdp-plot</program>. The command

    $ mcdp-solve empty "<>"

produces the output:

    Minimal resources needed = ↑{⟨⟩}

The output means that it is feasible to do nothing, and to do nothing
we need nothing. Formally, the question is "What are the minimal
resources necessary to perform $\fun=\langle\rangle$?"
and the answer is "To perform $\fun=\langle\rangle$,
you need at least $\res=\langle\rangle$".


## Defining functionality and resources


The functionality and resources of an MCDP are defined using
the keywords <code><f>provides</f></code> and <code><r>requires</r></code>:

<col2>
    <pre class='mcdp' id='model1' figure-id='code:model1'>
    mcdp {
        provides capacity [J]
        requires mass [g]
    }
    </pre>
    <render class='fancy_editor_LR' figure-id="fig:model1">
    `model1
    </render>
</col2>

The code above defines an MCDP with one functionality,
<f>capacity</f>, measured in joules,
and one resource, <r>mass</r>, measured in grams.

That is, the functionality space is $\funsp=\overline{\reals}_{+}^{[\text{J}]}$ and
the resource space is $\ressp=\overline{\reals}_{+}^{[\text{g}]}$. Here, let $\overline{\reals}_{+}^{[g]}$ refers to the nonnegative real numbers with units of grams.<footnote>Of course, internally this is
represented using floating points. See [](#sub:Rcomp) for more details.</footnote>

The MCDP defined above is, however, unusable, because we have
not specified how ``capacity`` and ``mass`` relate to one another.
Graphically, this is represented using  unconnected arrows
([](#fig:model1)).

<render class='fancy_editor_LR' figure-id="fig:model1">
    `model1
</render> -->

### Constant functionality and resources

The MCDP in <a href="#code:model1"/> is not complete, as we have not
defined what constraints <f>capacity</f> and <r>mass</r> must satisfy.

<a href='#code:model2'/> is a minimal example of a complete MCDP.
We have given hard bounds to both <f>capacity</f> and <r>mass</r>.

<col2>
    <pre class='mcdp' id='model2' figure-id="code:model2">
    mcdp {
    provides capacity [J]
    requires mass [g]

    provided capacity ≼ 500 J
    required mass ≽ 100g
    }
    </pre>
    <render class='ndp_graph_enclosed' figure-id="fig:model2">
        `model2
    </render>
</col2>


It is possible to query this minimal example. For example:

    $ mcdp-solve minimal "400 J"

The answer is:

    Minimal resources needed: mass = ↑ {100 g}


If we ask for more than the MCDP can provide:

    $ mcdp-solve minimal "600 J"

we obtain no solutions (the empty set):

    Minimal resources needed: mass = ↑{}

The notation `↑{}` means "the upper closure of the empty set $\emptyset$" ([](#def:upperclosure)), which is equal to $\emptyset$.


### Describing relations between functionality and resources

In MCDPs, functionality and resources can depend on each other using
any monotone relations ([](#def:monotone-relation)).

The language MCDPL contains as primitives addition,
multiplication, and division. For example, we can describe a linear relation between
mass and capacity, given by the specific energy, using the following line:

<pre class='mcdp_statements'>
    ρ = 4 J / g
    required mass ≽ provided capacity / ρ
</pre>

In the graphical representation (<a href="#fig:model4"/>), there is now
a connection between <f>capacity</f> and <r>mass</r>, with a DP that
multiplies by the inverse of the specific energy.


<col2>
    <pre class='mcdp' id='model4' label='linear.mcdp'>
    mcdp {
        provides capacity [J]
        requires mass [g]

        # specific energy
        ρ = 4 J / g
        required mass ≽ provided capacity / ρ
    }
    </pre>
    <render class='ndp_graph_enclosed'
    figure-id='fig:model4'>`model4</render>
</col2>


If we ask for more than the MCDP can provide:

    $ mcdp-solve linear "600 J"

we obtain no solutions (the empty set):

    Minimal resources needed: mass = ↑{150 g}

<!--
<pre class='print_value'>
solve(600J,`model4)
</pre> -->


### Units

PyMCDP is picky about units. It will complain if any operation does
not have the required dimensionality. However, as long as the dimensionality
is correct, it will automatically convert to and from equivalent units.
For example, in <a href="#code:conversion"/> the specific energy given
in <mcdp-poset>kWh/kg</mcdp-poset>. The two MCDPs are equivalent. PyMCDP will take care of
the conversions that are needed, and will introduce a conversion from
<mcdp-poset>J*kg/kWh</mcdp-poset> to <mcdp-poset>g</mcdp-poset> (<a href="#fig:conversion"/>).

<!-- TODO: add pointers to problems with conversions: Glimli Glider, Ariane? -->

For example, [](#code:conversion) is the same example with the specific
energy given in <mcdp-poset>kWh/kg</mcdp-poset>.
The output of the two models are completely equivalent (up to numerical errors).

<col2>
    <pre class='mcdp' id='model5' figure-id='code:conversion'
    figure-caption='Automatic conversion among g, kg, J, kWh'>
    mcdp {
    provides capacity [J]
    requires mass [g]

    # specific energy
    ρ = 200 kWh / kg
    required mass ≽ provided capacity / ρ
    }
    </pre>
    <render class='ndp_graph_enclosed_LR'
            figure-id="fig:conversion">
            `model5
    </render>
</col2>
