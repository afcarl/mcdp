## Basics

The goal of the language is to represent all and only [MCDPs (Monotone Co-Design
Problems)](#def:MCDP). For example, multiplying by a negative number is a syntax
error.
<!-- <footnote>Similarly, CVX's~\cite{cvx} goal
is to describe all only convex problems.</footnote> -->

The interface of each subsystem is specified
by its <f>functionality</f> and its <r>resources</r>.

#### Composition

The language encourages a compositional approach to co-design.

There are several notions of "compositions" between two design problems (DPs)
for which MCDPL provides syntactic constructs:

* *series* ([](#subfig:series)): two DPs can be connected in series
  if the second provides
  the resources required by the first.
* *parallel* ([](#subfig:parallel)): \xxx
* *coproduct* ([](#subfig:coproduct)): Two DPs can describe two alternatives
* *recursive* ([](#subfig:hierarchical)): A larger DPs can be defined as the
  interconnection of smaller, primitive DPs.
* *templating* ([](#subfig:templating)): \xxx
