mcdp {  
  provides endurance [s] 
  provides payload   [kg]
 
  battery = instance load battery1
  actuation = instance load actuation1

  capacity provided by battery >= 
    endurance * (power required by actuation)
 
  g = 9.81 m/s^2
 
  total_mass = (mass required by battery + mass required by actuation + payload)

  lift provided by actuation >= total_mass * g

  requires mass for battery
