mcdp {  
 provides endurance [s] 
 provides payload   [kg]
 
 battery = instance load battery1
 actuation = instance load actuation1

 capacity provided by battery >= 
    endurance * (power required by actuation)
 
 g = 9.81 m/s^2
 
 lift provided by actuation >=
    (mass required by battery + payload) * g

	requires mass for battery
