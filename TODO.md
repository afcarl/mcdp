Goals:

(*) Unified solving interface, for interactive and batch drawing.
    - (interactive) I can drag over and I see the shape change
    - I can see the animation 


(*) Symmetrization for functionality/resources

    The challenge is creating dual of certain DPs, such as Mux DPs.

    This enables to compute stable(h1 h2*) or stable(h2 h1*)


(*) Esthetics

    - have one icon for each library (library_icon.png)

    - display the dependency graph among libraries


On hold: 

(*) Interface with cvxpy
(*) Demo for QR code
 
- B: > NotImplementedError: SumNLDP:solve_r: Cannot invert more than two terms.
Write "details mcdplib-actuation-ndp-duckiebot_sol00-ndp_check_solve_r_chain" to inspect the error.

- use greek letters in h*
- implement solve-r 

- Introduce "Ignore" blocks, so that they can get their own icon (terminator)
- performance: duckiebot_sol00 is veeery slow. Is it because we are doing "ignoring"

Technical debt:

- 'ignore resources' should modify the diagram, not create a wrapper.
- remove all the symlinks

- remove normal form
- remove caching from LoopDP; make separate class
- remove caching from Library, make separate class

- T: 
- B:crash: unicode chars in source: http://
127.0.0.1:8080/libraries/example-catalogue/models/simple_cell/views/edit_fancy/

- B: in the dp_flow pictures, the CoProduct is not expanded.


- F: color the constants to reflect whether they are funcs or resources
- F: automatically make the constant into a new function or resource

--------------------

- InvPlus2 -> InvPlusN

- Create "add_bottom(<poset>)" and "add_top" operator. 



- Create type "{{poset}}", "{{mcdp}}", "{{template}}", "{{name}}", etc. to use in the documentation as stand-alone. 

- bug doc: Ravpower assume 110: The model says we have two options: we need to find an outlet of TypeM at either 110 V or 220 V which will provide 5 W of power. Moreover, we need at least 10.99 USD to buy the component.

- bug visualization: splits are not drawn well. See, e.g.,
http://ares-super.lids.mit.edu/~andrea/env_mcdp/src/mcdp/out/check_rendering/plugs/sockets.md.html


- test ignore_resource  for wrong inputs


Keys:

- R: refactoring / reorganization
- F: features
- L: language features
- B: bugs
- T: testing


Bugs
-----

- throw semanticerror instead of internalerror when there are repeated identifiers
mcdp {
   requires shape [m x m x m]
   requires shape >= <6.5in, 2in, 5.8in>



- is a device that provides the <code class='mcdp_poset'>`AngularPlacement</code> functionality
and to do so requires the <code class='mcdp_poset'>`PPM</code> functionality.


ValueError: If <pre> is empty then it needs to have an id.
tag: <code class="mcdp_poset"><code>AngularPlacement&lt;/code&gt; functionality
     and to do so requires the &lt;code class='mcdp_poset'&gt;</code>PPM</code>

==> use backtick escape  &#96;

- F: parse custom string for PosetCoproduct
- B: refresh library does not reset the icon caches
- B: what happens with recursive definitions? (a.poset = "`a")

- now the edges that are not connected are not purple

- B: if the syntax is not correct, it is not displayed at all.
  http://127.0.0.1:8080/libraries/duckiebot_components/models/pimoroni_inc/views/syntax/

- F: SVG for dpgraph http://127.0.0.1:8080/libraries/droneD_complete.v2/models/perception/views/dp_graph/




Meat
----
- "op(Poset)" => constructs opposite poset

- intervals - what happens


- L: Add something like:

  my_npd.mcdp
  from-code('module.function', {param1=..., param2=...})
 
Misc
-----

 

MCDP-web
----------

- R: add license information

- F: add credits to free sw in the initial page

- F: library list: templates


- F: list links to *.md documents in the initial library page
- F: better initial list for each library

- F: rename model

- F: delete model

- T: mcdp-web: Testing of at least all links.


- B: (low) when drawing images, use a unicode font
- F: send to non-fancy for internet explorer

- F: mcdp-web: nice CSS all around

- F: mcdp-web: let images be zoomable

- B: fancy_editor: the syntax highlighting skips the whitespace at the end of the model

- B: mcdp-web: make sure that everything works when packaged

- F: create static versions of documents

- B: we need to escape # in interactive. Maybe hexify?
http://127.0.0.1:8080/interactive/mcdp_value/#finite_poset { %0A    a <= b <= c  %0A    x <= c <= d # test%0A    e <= a1 # test%0A}


MCDP-web / QR
-------------

- put the "new model" link everywhere (list of models, /index)
- put the navigation bar everywhere


- B: unicode characters such as âŸ¨ give server-side error


Bugs
----

- B: FinitePoset does not have Join, Meet

- B: Sometimes Pint does not simplify the units. For example,
      J * kg / Wh has the same dimensionality of kg

- B: compact() is bugged - it has to do with splits. Try compact DroneComplete.

- B: "(provided lift)^2" does not parse
- B: "nat:2 / 1 []"

There is already a connection to function 'r1' of '_res_r1'.


 line  4 >  requires r2 [R]
 line  5 >
 line  6 >  f1  <= 1 [] + (r1 * (r2 + r1)  )
            ^
            |
            here or nearby
```

- F: nice icon for  operations: take
- F: nice icon for  operations: meet, Join


- B: there is now an ugly hack (Catch exception ) when plotting in gg_*

Language additions
------------------ 

- L: types: Sets without the order. For example, given V, use set(V).

- L: Implement Python-style comments for more literate programming.

```
mcdp {
   """ this is the comment """

  provides x [J] "This is a comment for the description"
}
```
 
- Bug in the dot drawing for this one:

choose(
        NiMH: mcdp { a = instance mcdp {
provides f1 <= 10g
requires r1 >= f1
}
}
)

- F: "choose()" without labels
   (get rid of ^?)


- F: better catalouge syntax - implicit point


  Putin = catalogue {
     provides plutonium [g]
     requires science [`scientific_objectives]
     100g | `scientific_objectives : find_current_life
     implicit : 100g | `scientific_objectives : find_current_life
  }

  catalouge {
     provides resolution [pixels]
     requires latency [s]

     500 pixels => 10
  }



- g: visualize PlusNat as "+ x"


- bug: This should have a better error message
   <code class='mcdp_value'>`my_poset: <em>element</em></code>.

    ValueError: If <pre> is empty then it needs to have an id.
    tag: <code class="mcdp_value">`my_poset: <em>element</em></code>
